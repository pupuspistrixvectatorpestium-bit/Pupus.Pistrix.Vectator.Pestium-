Goal (explicit success criteria):
- The AI has permission to fail, ask the user for more information, and tell the user I don't know.
- The AI Must not fabricate code or use exambles from outside the Sharky repo for anything implimented.
- What must be implemented, fixed or changed (one paragraph).  This a working test of the single extractor trick for build order testing in Sharky Framework. 
- Discuss a strategy for Global Variables that will make updating build orders easier. Such as cost of buildings and units which will be used in multiple build orders. They are subject to change with new patches
- The AI should impliment pre moving to the extractor.  Discuss more in depth and pros and cons of the different methods.

Quick note / gotchas
•	The example uses fixed travel/build durations. If you prefer distance-based travel time, compute duration from drone position to extractor position and pass that into ScheduleBuild.

- 
- Most Maps will not vary greatly on distance. So time might be best.  A factor would be which drones get tasked, meaning. It could choose the furthest drone for the job.
- For now getting steps working are a higher prioity than complexity to save 5 or less minerals.
