Goal (explicit success criteria):
- The AI has permission to fail, ask the user for more information, and tell the user I don't know.
- The AI Must not fabricate code or use exambles from outside the Sharky repo.  
- What must be implemented, fixed or changed (one paragraph).  The second Hackery is a wall-off at the top not the Natural
- Measurable acceptance criteria (compile, tests pass, performance target, behavior). The Hatchery should close one side of the ramp with a wall-off
