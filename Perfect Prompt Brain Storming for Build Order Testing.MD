Goal (explicit success criteria):
- The AI has permission to fail, ask the user for more information, and tell the user I don't know.
- The AI Must not fabricate code or use exambles from outside the Sharky repo for anything implimented.
- The AI can use outside knowledge to help brainstorm ideas and structures for testing build orders.  
- What must be implemented, fixed or changed (one paragraph).  This is a brainstorming session to create the perfect prompt to get the AI to help me with Build Order testing in Sharky Framework.  The AI must help me create come up structures and ideas that will allow me to test build orders effectively within the Sharky framework, ensuring that the tests are comprehensive and cover all necessary scenarios.
- User would like to seperate parts of the build order into different parts, calls, and or files
    - The 16/14 Double Extractor could become ZergBuildDoubleExtractorTrick.cs
    - That would be called from ZergBuildSimCity.cs that is called from ZergBuildChoices.cs
